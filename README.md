Use your own hibernate.cfg.xml file. Wanted to post this incase you havent figured out the update function yet. 
Premade 3 employees accounts with values that were easy to manipulate to make sure all of the functions were
giving me the desired output. will go in and fix styling later will also input the proper databases once i get all the functions 
running. sorry its sloppy rn
